# how to learn rust
from video of [no boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hXNd6x9sZs), my journey to learn rust

# sources
* the rust programming language book -> "the book" -> "rust-programming-language-steve-klabnik.pdf"
* [rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
* [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
* [rust by practice](https://practice.rs/why-exercise.html)

rustlings written in almost same order as the book
rust by example is a suppolement to the book -> more opinionated on how to use them

# start
read the book once as fast as possible and `dont do exercises`
if you come across something you dont understand `mentally note it and move on`
this is to get a basic understanding on everything in the book


# read book second time with rustlings
at normal pace
read the [brown university version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) -> it includes exercises
install rustlings
also read [rust by practice](https://practice.rs/why-exercise.html)

```
rustling exercises are like caters -> you do them over and over again to build muscle memory
```

# learn haskell
uses principles similiar to rust but is more strict
the better functionalities in rust are similiar to haskell
sources:
* [learn you a haskell for a great good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
* [real world haskell](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)

`you can read through these quickly`
haskell will teach you about mapping, filtering, folding, carrying, matching and other to describe algorithms in rust that are abbandoned in other languages that use just use for loops and if statements

# think about rust syntax
compiler helps you -> it is easier to create complex things
avoids crashing by creating solid structure in your code

# naming conventions
